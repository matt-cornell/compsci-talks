# So what is functional programming, anyway?

Functional programming is, perhaps unsurprisingly, programming involving functions. Now, most languages have functions, so this might not sound too special, but with FP, functions are used to model behavior in ways that one typically wouldn't in an procedural language. Many of the concepts in functional programming are abstract and take on an almost mathematical feel compared to other paradigms. Despite this, you don't actually need to be good at math to be a functional programmer, as long as you're willing to learn the terminology, which has been borrowed from certain fields of category theory.

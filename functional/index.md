# Functional Programming

To a procedural programmer, functional programming may seem strange, even alien at first, but it's one of my favorite paradigms, and with some experience, it can be a very powerful tool. Talks in this section will also serve as a sort of tutorial to Haskell, as it's pretty much the purest functional language. Generally, purity to this degree makes it difficult to use a language, but in this case, that becomes a strength as it allows us to focus on only functional patterns.

These talks assume some basic degree of programming knowledge, at least enough to follow along with annotated code, but it shouldn't require the reader to have any experience with functional programming or know any particular language. If it does, feel free to open an issue and yell at me!

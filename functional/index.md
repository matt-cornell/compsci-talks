# Functional Programming

To a procedural programmer, functional programming may seem strange, even alien at first, but it's one of my favorite paradigms, and with some experience, it can be a very powerful tool. Talks in this section will also serve as a sort of tutorial to Haskell, as it's pretty much the purest functional language. Generally, purity to this degree makes it difficult to use a language, but in this case, that becomes a strength as it allows us to focus on only functional patterns.
